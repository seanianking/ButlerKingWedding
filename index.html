    Greetings! On this page you'll find a little bit of information about me, and a picture of my adorable little family. To find see some of my projects you can visit my workshop using the "more" dropdown, my resume is on that page too. Using that same dropdown you can also reach out to me, I look forward to hearing from you! While you're on this page though, search closely. I keep company with a pretty colorful wizard, but he's shy around new people. If you introduce yourself by clicking on him, I'm sure he'll show himself and say hi.

        About Me
      </h2>
      <p class="aboutText">
        I grew up in Provo, Utah and throughout my life have done everything I can to find new things to do. 
        I played football and rugby, competed in the Skills USA graphic design and screen printing contests, 
        and particularly enjoyed trips to cadaver labs and museums.
      </p>
      <p class="aboutText">
        There's a lot that brought me to coding and web development as a career. 
        My dad has been a software engineer for his whole career, 
        so I have always been around computers and wanted to learn more about them. 
        Coding isn't just a way for me to learn more about computers, but also more about how they work.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutText">
        When I have a little free time, I'll usually spend it going on an adventure with my wife and daughter. 
        But when I can't do that, I'll try to go on an adventure playing Dungeons and Dragons or other tabletop games, 
        or playing a video game of nearly any kind.
